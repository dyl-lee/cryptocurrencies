## Purpose 
Cryptocurrency data was subjected to unsupervised learning to detect any existing trends. The data contains many features and was preprocessed for dimension reduction by principle component analysis (3 principle components) in order to improve the performance of KMeans clustering algorithm (4 K-clusters). Finally, the clustered data was visualized using hvplot to see the distinct groups corresponding to the principal components generated.
